  <h1>Interacting with Data</h1>
  <h2>U.S. Voter Frequency, Education, & Income</h2>
  <p>This visualization reveals that college educated voters generally vote more frequently than less educated voters.
    College educated has the largest proportion of Always voters and smallest proportion of Never voters out of the three education categories.
    Similarly, by highlighting data ribbons by income level, we see higher income voters tend to vote more frequently than lower income voters.</p>

  <h2>Voter Turnout & Absentee Votes in Virginia Cities & Counties</h2>
  <p> This figure reveals trends in voter turnout and absentee voting in Virginia localities. 
    Note that percentages of Voter Turnout and Absentee Voters were higher in 2020, when we had a Presidential election and we voted from home due to the Pandemic.
  Similarly, note that two of the years shown, 2016 and 2020, were Presidential elections, 
  and we see a dramatic shift in the bubbles representing voter turnout (%) to the right, as there was higher voter turnout for those elections. </p>

  <h2>Virginia Voter Turnout </h2>
  <p> In this map of voter (turnout as a percentage of active registered voters) by Virginia county/city, we see trends of lower voter turnout in the Appalachian Plateau (far western Virginia) 
    and higher voter turnout in central and eastern Virginia. Western localities are generally lighter in fill color than the central and eastern regions,
    corresponding to higher voter turnout.  </p>
